/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0: Variables are named containers for data in Javascript.
 *  - var, let and const are the key words that tells javascript you're declaring a variable
 *     *var keyword has been used in all javascript code since 1995*
 *     *let and const keywords were added in 2015, primarily to avoid repeating declared var 
 * 
 * 1. Declaration: 
 *      var - can be reassigned, redeclared, hoisted
 *          ex. var snowball; 
 * 
        let - can be reassigned, cannot be redeclared or hoisted, can be initialized
            ex. let snowball;

        const - cannot be reassigned, redclared, hoisted, must be initilized
            ex. const snowball;
 *  
 * 
 * 2. Assignment/Initialization :
 *  - To assign a variable you use the = operator
 *      ex. console.log(var snowball = "Tiger's Blood");// prints -> "Tiger's Blood"
 * 
 *  - When a variable is left unassigned, it will log undefined 
 *      ex. console.log(var snowball;)// prints -> undefined
 * 
 * 3. Reassignment:
 *  - changing or updating the value of a previously assigned variable
 *      ex. snowball = "Jungle Juice";
 *      console.log(snowball);// prints -> "Jungle Juice"
 * 
 * 4. Hoisting:
